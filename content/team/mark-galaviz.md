His attitude and willingness to assist has helped him create relationships within the real estate community that lead to cooperation and smooth transactions with cooperating Brokers.

Mark also believes "The Right Home Sells Itself" and his buyers are treated with zero sales pressure. Mark likens a real estate transaction to an airplane ride – you're apt to run into turbulence. However, with Mark in the captain's seat and his team as the flight crew, you'll have the skill and experience on your side to avoid the turbulence and enjoy the ride. But knowledge, systems, and skills are not the most important reasons why clients enjoy working with him. The most important reason is trust.

Mark has dedicated his career to serving clients for life. As a result, most of his clients come to him by referral from friends, family, and happy past clients. They refer to him without reservation because they know they can trust him to give his honest opinion, even if it means "No sale." They know they can trust him to protect his clients with a "win-win" or "no deal" way of negotiating, and to work tirelessly to solve any problems, while keeping the Golden Rule in mind.It's important to Mark to be the best REALTOR® a client could hope for. At the same time he takes time for family, friends and fun in order to "Have a Life Worth Living." He wishes the same for you, so don't be surprised if along with asking about your real estate needs, he asks "What do you like to do for fun?"
