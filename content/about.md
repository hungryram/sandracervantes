Our philosophy is different than that of a franchised real estate company because we realize each property is unique. Buyers and Sellers deserve our undivided attention. Marketing plans should be flexible, commissions negotiable depending upon the transaction, and the customers satisfaction should always be the goal.

Here you will find a wide variety of useful information and resources designed to help you buy or sell a home more effectively in Southern California. From advice about finding a mortgage or preparing your home to sell, it's all available here on our web site.

You can also search for your ideal home by viewing current listings with detailed descriptions and photos. Or you can get help determining the value of your home by requesting a report that includes the prices of similar homes that recently sold or are currently for sale.

So whether you are buying or selling, feel free to [contact us](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wallstrealty.com%2Fdefault.asp.f-contactme%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0ib0bHAdN6Vg78nsqftayDxoSXpqUBZXvwa_Xu-HqJHSoWOpPy0xzCEtU&h=AT2CKuRsDM22nomP2ekbp3ZiCeUAvgxwtCfdY5p9JIZW7SYajnhDsR4I6q7RHN8-Haovo_HpdhV-TkMouAIBxMOHGxMng6KfW6o_CB91YrsaOj_tsTa3V2OuHg4qU-w2Gmr-_-7srIH-koZ6s5k24g) and we will be happy to help you with all of your real estate needs
